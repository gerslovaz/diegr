# diegr

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The name diegr comes from Dynamic and Interactive EEG Graphics using R. The package is developed to display high-density electroencephalography (HD-EEG) data in different ways using interactive elements or animations for a comprehensive overview of data.
The package diegr includes: 
 - interactive boxplots 
 - interactive epoch waveforms
 - topographic maps (2D projection) 
 - head plots in 3D

## Installation

You can install the development version of diegr from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("gerslovaz/diegr")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to plot interactive epoch boxplots in different time points for one subject:

```{r example}
library(diegr)
data(epochdata)
boxplot_epoch(epochdata, subject = 1, channel = "E3", time_lim = c(260:270))
```

<!-- What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so: -->

<!-- ```{r cars} -->
<!-- summary(cars) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. -->

<!-- You can also embed plots, for example: -->

<!-- ```{r pressure, echo = FALSE} -->
<!-- plot(pressure) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN. -->
