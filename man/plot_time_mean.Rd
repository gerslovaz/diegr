\usage{
plot_time_mean(
  data,
  condition_column = NULL,
  FS = 250,
  t0 = 1,
  transp = 0.4,
  y_limits = NULL,
  label_0ms = "stimulus",
  label_offset = c(0, 0),
  legend_title = "Condition"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame, tibble or a database table with input data to plot. It should be an output from \code{\link{compute_mean}} function or an object with the same structure, containing columns: \code{time} with labels of time points and \code{average}, \code{ci_low}, \code{ci_up} with values of average signal and lower and upper CI bounds.}

\item{condition_column}{Character string specifying the name of the column used to define conditions for plotting. If \code{NULL}, all observations are treated as a single condition.}

\item{FS}{The sampling frequency. Default value is 250 Hz.}

\item{t0}{Index of the zero time point, i.e. point, where 0 ms should be marked (most often time of the stimulus or time of the response).}

\item{transp}{A numeric value between 0 and 1 controlling the transparency of the confidence ribbon (corresponding to \code{alpha} parameter in \link[ggplot2]{geom_ribbon} function).}

\item{y_limits}{A numeric vector of length two, specifying the minimum and maximum y-axis limits. Defaults to \code{NULL}for plot limits determined according to input data.}

\item{label_0ms}{Character string for the annotation label at the 0ms mark. Default is \code{"stimulus"}.}

\item{label_offset}{A numeric vector of length two to offset the stimulus label. The first value indicates a horizontal shift, the second a vertical one. Default is \code{c(0,0)} for no shift.}

\item{legend_title}{Character string specifying the legend title shown in the plot. Default is \code{"Condition"}. For all observations treated as a single condition (\code{condition_column = NULL}) is plotted no legend.}
}
\value{
A \code{ggplot} object showing the time course of the average EEG signal with pointwise confidence intervals.
}
\description{
Plot a time course of the average EEG signal amplitude with pointwise confidence intervals (CIs), colour-coded by a user-defined grouping variable such as experimental condition, subject or group. If the \code{condition_column} is \code{NULL}, all observations are treated as a single condition.
}
\details{
The output in the form of a ggplot object allows to easily edit the result image properties.

\examples{
# Plot average signal with CI bounds from the sensor E65 excluding outlier epochs (14 and 15)
# for subject 2 - part b) and for the both subjects treated as conditions - part c)

# a) preparing data
# a1) extract required data
edata <- pick_data(epochdata, sensor_rg = c("E65"), epoch_rg = 1:13)
# a2) baseline correction
data_base <- baseline_correction(edata, baseline_range = 1:10)
# a3) average computing
data_mean <- compute_mean(data_base, amplitude = "signal_base", channel = "E65",
 type = "point")

# b) filter subject 2 and plot the average line with default settings
# (the whole dataset treated as one condition, no legend plotted)
data_mean2 <- data_mean |>
dplyr::filter(subject == 2) # or use pick_data(data_mean, subject_rg = 2)
plot_time_mean(data = data_mean2, t0 = 10)

# c) plot the time course by subject (treated as a condition)
plot_time_mean(data = data_mean, condition_column = "subject", t0 = 10, legend_title = "Subject")

# Plot average signal with CI bounds for subject 1 from three chosen sensors
# preparing data
edata <- pick_data(epochdata, subject_rg = 1, sensor_rg = c("E5", "E35" ,"E65"),
                 epoch_rg = 1:13)
data_base <- baseline_correction(edata, baseline_range = 1:10)
data_mean <- compute_mean(data_base, amplitude = "signal_base", type = "point")
# plot the time course by sensor (channel)
plot_time_mean(data = data_mean, condition_column = "sensor", t0 = 10, legend_title = "Channel")
